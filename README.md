# Retaining Walls Performance
Research project implimenting MEMS sensors monitoring technologies into retaining walls construction.

The project looks forward to develop a warning and remote access system to soil movements caused by excavations with the use of open source software. Other aplications as talings dams colapse and landslide prevention are evaluated.
